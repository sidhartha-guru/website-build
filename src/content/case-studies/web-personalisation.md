## Context
Improving discovery and relevance on the web funnel was a major lever for bookings. The challenge was scaling personalization beyond one-off experiments.

## Role & Scope
Led strategy and roadmap; built a high-performing team across backend, frontend, and ML capabilities.

## Problem
How can we enable teams to launch high-quality personalization experiences quickly, safely, and measurably across the funnel?

## Approach
- **Product vision:** articulated a clear platform direction that earned executive sponsorship.
- **Platform investment:** built reusable capabilities for segmentation, A/B/n testing, and ranking.
- **Enablement:** created a no-code layer so internal teams could launch experiences without heavy engineering lift.

## Outcomes
- Delivered material booking uplift (~500 bps).
- Enabled 120+ campaigns launched in the first year through the no-code platform.

## Tradeoffs
Optimized for repeatable, governed experimentation rather than bespoke “hero” features.

## Learnings
Personalization scales when experimentation, governance, and ML tooling are treated as a platform — not a project.
