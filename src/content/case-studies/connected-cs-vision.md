## Context
Customer service at scale requires both great customer experience and operational leverage. The opportunity was to reduce friction for customers while reducing cost-to-serve through automation and smarter routing.

## Role & Scope
Group Product Manager leading multiple cross-functional teams across agent tooling, support channels, and automations.

## Problem
How might we shift from human-heavy support to an automation-first model without sacrificing CSAT — while enabling the org to execute reliably across teams and vendors?

## Approach
- **Vision & alignment:** built a 3-year narrative (“Connected CS”) that senior stakeholders could sponsor.
- **Capability roadmap:** mapped foundational platform capabilities (routing, proactive comms, knowledge, analytics) to outcomes.
- **Vendor strategy:** orchestrated a structured assessment across Ops/Tech/Finance to select next-gen contact center direction.
- **Execution capacity:** helped establish a Center of Excellence to accelerate delivery.

## Outcomes
- Reduced operational cost through proactive communication and smarter routing.
- Shipped pilots for AI-powered knowledge and contact analysis to improve agent efficiency.

## Tradeoffs
Chose a platform-first approach over scattered point solutions to ensure compounding benefits and maintainability.

## Learnings
Automation works best when paired with clear policy, strong measurement, and an operating model that scales.
