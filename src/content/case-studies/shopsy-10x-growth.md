## Context
Flipkart wanted to capture the “value” and second-hand/refurbished opportunity—an audience with distinct trust, price, and convenience barriers compared to mainstream e-commerce.

## Role & Scope
Product owner for Android app, desktop, and mobile web for Shopsy.in. Accountable for platform launch, user acquisition, and end-to-end conversion funnel performance.

## Problem
How do you launch a differentiated value platform and grow it quickly—while reducing key purchase barriers like trust, quality uncertainty, and post-purchase anxiety?

## Approach
### 1) Start with barriers, not features
Mapped the highest-friction moments in the funnel (discovery → trust → checkout → post-purchase confidence) and prioritized a small set of “unlock” bets.

### 2) Build a differentiated refurbished proposition
Partnered across the org to create a certified refurbished platform, focusing on:
- Quality signals and customer trust cues
- Clear policies (returns/warranty where applicable)
- Funnel clarity (what you get, what condition, what happens if it fails)

### 3) Scale distribution and activation loops
Drove growth by expanding channels and tightening activation:
- Channel expansion (new acquisition sources)
- Targeted marketing with sharper value propositions
- Referral mechanics to compound growth

### 4) Operate like a business
Built a measurement cadence around funnel metrics (activation, conversion, repeat), and used rapid iteration to improve outcomes.

## Outcomes
- Launched the platform and scaled it from 0→1.
- Drove ~10× user growth in 1 year through channel expansion, targeted marketing, and referrals.
- Coordinated delivery across 22+ product teams to ship a cohesive experience.

## Tradeoffs
Optimized for repeatable, measurable growth loops over bespoke feature work—keeping scope tight so learning velocity stayed high.

## Learnings
For value segments, trust and post-purchase confidence are often the real conversion levers. Growth compounds when the product reduces anxiety and distribution loops are designed intentionally.
